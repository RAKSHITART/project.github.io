        <h2>Introduction to Project</h2>
        <p>In the City Design Project, my group chose the Mall Management System and explored different business cases to apply the algorithms. I worked on the following:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Parking Lot Management System</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This system assigns parking slots to customers based on proximity to mall entrances, optimizing convenience.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parking slots are sorted using <strong>Selection Sort</strong>, ranking them by distance.</li>
            <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> dynamically assigns the nearest available slot to visitors.</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Customer Navigation System</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Guides customers along the shortest path between two points in the mall.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The mall is represented as a graph where nodes are locations (e.g., shops) and edges are paths.</li>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong> calculates the shortest path between two points.</li>
            <li>A <strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong> stores shop locations for efficient lookups.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Searching for Products in a Mall Directory</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enables customers to search for specific products or categories (e.g., "electronics," "fashion") in the mall directory.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rabin-Karp Algorithm</strong> is used for efficient searching by comparing hash values.</li>
            <li>Hash values are calculated for the search term and matched against substrings in the directory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mapping SDGs to My Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Parking Slot Management System</h3>
        <p>My Parking Slot Management System optimizes space allocation and contributes to the following SDGs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong> - Reduces traffic congestion and enhances urban infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</strong> - Demonstrates the power of technology to improve infrastructure management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Customer Navigation System in a Mall</h3>
        <p>This system helps customers navigate malls efficiently, supporting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong> - Enhances accessibility and consumer satisfaction in urban areas.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</strong> - Utilizes advanced algorithms for route optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> - Reduces time wastage and promotes responsible consumer behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Product/Category Search in a Mall Directory</h3>
        <p>My directory search system employs efficient algorithms to contribute to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> - Helps customers find products responsibly and effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</strong> - Enhances the shopping experience, boosting sales and economic growth.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</strong> - Highlights the use of cutting-edge search algorithms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Through this project, I gained valuable insights into how concepts are applied in real-world scenarios and how to implement them effectively. While understanding the theoretical aspects of the topics was relatively easy, the real challenge lay in translating these concepts into practical applications using coding languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working on the course project provided a unique learning experience. Collaborating with a team helped distribute the workload and made tackling the challenges more manageable. I learned the importance of teamwork and how collective efforts can lead to better solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project not only deepened my understanding of algorithms but also gave me a glimpse into their real-life applications. It was fascinating to see how the algorithms we studied are embedded in the systems we use daily. Overall, this experience has significantly enhanced my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of real-world technology.
