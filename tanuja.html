    <h1>Patrol Route Optimization</h1>
    <p>Using Prim's Algorithm for Efficient Coverage</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The goal of this algorithm is to optimize the patrol route for security guards in a mall. The guards need to cover all critical areas (checkpoints) while minimizing the total walking distance. By doing so, the overall efficiency and response time of the guards are improved.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Algorithm: Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h2>
    <p>Prim's algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph, where each checkpoint is a node and the walking distances are edges connecting them. The MST ensures that all nodes are connected with the minimum total distance and no cycles.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Graph Representation:</strong> Each checkpoint is represented as a node. The edges between the nodes represent the walking distances between the checkpoints.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):</strong> Apply Prim's algorithm to find the MST that connects all nodes with the minimal total distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Patrol Route Optimization:</strong> The MST is used to determine the optimal patrol route for the security guards, ensuring efficient coverage and minimizing unnecessary travel.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Benefits of MST</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimized Travel Time:</strong> By minimizing the walking distance, guards can save time and energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Coverage:</strong> All checkpoints are covered without redundancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimized Response:</strong> Faster response times to any incidents or emergencies, improving overall security efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By using Prim's algorithm, we can efficiently optimize the patrol routes of security guards, improving both operational effectiveness and response time, ultimately enhancing the safety and security of the mall.</p>
