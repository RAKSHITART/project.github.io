    <h1>Mall Security Patrol Optimization Using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h1>
    <p>
        To optimize the patrol route for mall security guards, we leverage the concept of a 
        <strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</strong>. This approach ensures all critical checkpoints are covered while 
        minimizing the total walking distance.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps Involved</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Checkpoints as Nodes:</strong> Represent each security checkpoint as a node in a graph.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Distances as Edges:</strong> Use the walking distances between checkpoints as the weights of the 
            edges connecting these nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MST Algorithm:</strong> Apply Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree. 
            This tree connects all nodes (checkpoints) while minimizing the total edge weight (walking distance).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Patrol Route:</strong> Use the MST as a guide to design the patrol route, ensuring all checkpoints 
            are efficiently connected and covered.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Benefits of Using MST</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimizes the total walking distance for security guards.</li>
        <li>Ensures all critical areas are included in the patrol route.</li>
        <li>Provides a systematic and optimized route for consistent coverage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Algorithm Details</h2>
    <p>
        Both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are suitable for constructing the MST:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong> Sort all edges by weight, and iteratively add the smallest edge to the 
            tree, ensuring no cycles are formed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prim's Algorithm:</strong> Start with an arbitrary node and grow the MST by adding the smallest 
            edge connecting the tree to a new node.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
        This technique is not only applicable to mall security but also to other scenarios requiring optimal coverage, 
        such as delivery route planning, surveillance system layout, and utility network design.
