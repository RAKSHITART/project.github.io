    <h1>Efficient Waste Management System</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to design an <strong>Efficient Waste Management System</strong> for a mall. The system ranks zones by waste generation levels, optimizes waste collection routes, and determines optimal waste chute locations to minimize travel distances for collection carts. The solution integrates <strong>Quick Sort</strong>, <strong>Depth First Search (DFS)</strong>, and <strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm</strong> to achieve these objectives.

        <h2>2. System Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zone Ranking:</strong> Quick Sort is used to rank mall zones based on waste generation levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Route Optimization:</strong> DFS identifies optimal routes for waste collection carts.</li>
            <li><strong>Chute Placement:</strong> Kruskal’s Algorithm determines the most efficient locations for waste chutes to minimize travel distances.</li>

        <h2>3. Key Concepts and Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Zone Ranking Using Quick Sort</h3>
        <p>
            Quick Sort is applied to rank zones in the mall based on their waste generation levels (e.g., high, medium, low).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input:</strong> Data on waste levels from different zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a pivot zone.</li>
                    <li>Partition zones into two groups: those generating more waste than the pivot and those generating less.</li>
                    <li>Recursively sort each group until all zones are ranked.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> A sorted list of zones prioritized by waste generation levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The algorithm has an average time complexity of <code>O(n log n)</code>.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Route Optimization Using DFS</h3>
        <p>
            DFS is used to plan efficient waste collection cart routes by ensuring that all zones are covered with minimal overlap.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input:</strong> A graph where nodes represent zones and edges represent paths between them.</li>
            <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start from a designated collection point.</li>
                    <li>Traverse paths to visit all zones, backtracking when necessary.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> A sequence of routes that minimizes redundant travel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> DFS ensures that every zone is visited exactly once.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Chute Placement Using Kruskal’s Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
            Kruskal’s Algorithm identifies the optimal placement of waste chutes by minimizing travel distances for waste collection carts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input:</strong> A weighted graph with nodes as potential chute locations and edges as distances between them.</li>
            <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sort edges by weight.</li>
                    <li>Incrementally add edges to the minimum spanning tree (MST), avoiding cycles.</li>
                    <li>Stop when all nodes are connected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> An MST highlighting optimal chute placements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Time complexity is <code>O(E log E)</code>, where <code>E</code> is the number of edges.</p>
